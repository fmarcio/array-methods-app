# Array methods App :computer:

Project made to practice some essential array methods: _map()_, _forEach()_, _reduce()_, _filter()_, _sort()_.
It's a simple app that fetches fake data about users and their wealth. Made with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.  

Although this app is based in one of Brad Traversy project from his courses, I added some extra features according to my preferences and also changed some styles.
